# Meeting 3 Notes
## Task 4
- For exploring api or ui go to metabase github: https://github.com/metabase/metabase
- The ui test cases are written in the `frontend/test/metabase` folders. Choose any one of it and research about it.
- The api test files are in `test/metabase/api` folder choose any one test case and write about it
## Task 5
- For Task 5, first clone the metabase to a folder.
- Then you need to install:
  - Nodejs: sudo apt install nodejs
  - NPM: sudo apt install npm
  - Yarn: sudo apt install yarn
- After that run `yarn build-hot`
- To run a unit test, they are in the `frontend/test/metabase` folders with file name unit.spec.js
- To run a single unit test run `yarn test-unit <filename>.unit.spec.js`
- Problem Faced: Cannot build yarn to run a frontend environment gives an error of uberbuild
